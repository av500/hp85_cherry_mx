using the orignal keycaps with 3d-printerd adapters to connect the Hitek caps to the Cherry MX stem pattern:

the space bar uses three key switches in parallel with two 3d-printed standoffs in the corners:

**all 3d-printed part were designed to work with my (then) "not so good" printer, they might need some tweaking in terms of tolerances, I included the OpenSCAD source files.**

the PCB was made in standard 1.6mm thickness, so in order to make the keyboard stiffer a second PCB was placed below and the pin holes drilled out accordingly:
